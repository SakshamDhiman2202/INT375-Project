Customer Churn Prediction Project
Project Goal
Build a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to stop using a service (churn). This helps businesses take early action to retain them.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains customer details:

CustomerID, Name, Age, Gender, Location

Subscription_Length_Months, Monthly_Bill, Total_Usage_GB

Churn (1 = Left, 0 = Stayed)

Technologies Used
Programming & Data Handling
Python (Main language for coding)

Pandas (Data cleaning & analysis)

NumPy (Math operations & arrays)

Visualization
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Graphs & charts)

Jupyter Notebook (Interactive coding & reports)

Machine Learning
Scikit-Learn (sklearn) (For building models)

Models Tested:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Advanced Techniques
StandardScaler (Normalizes data for better accuracy)

PCA (Reduces unnecessary data complexity)

GridSearchCV (Finds the best model settings)

Cross-Validation (Ensures reliable model performance)

Deep Learning (Optional)
TensorFlow & Keras (For neural networks)

Early Stopping (Prevents overfitting)

Model Evaluation
We check performance using:
✅ Accuracy (Overall correct predictions)
✅ Precision (Few false alarms)
✅ Recall (Few missed churners)
✅ ROC-AUC (How well model ranks risk)

Expected Outcome
A trained model that:
✔ Predicts high-risk customers before they leave
✔ Helps businesses save money by retaining customers
✔ Improves customer satisfaction & loyalty
